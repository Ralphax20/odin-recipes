            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill each empanada disk with about 1 tablespoon of your favorite filling. (Try lola's recipe for Empanada Pork Filling to make Filipino-style empanadas.) Fold the disk over the filling into a half-moon and seal firmly. Place empanadas onto a foil-lined baking sheet and brush the tops with beaten egg white. 
                Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ cup water</li>
                <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour for dusting</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Whisk 2 cups flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl until well blended. Make a well in the center.</li>
                <li> Whisk water and egg yolk together in a small bowl until smooth; pour into the well and mix to form a stiff dough.</li>
                <li> Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Roll dough with a rolling pin until thin, dusting with flour as needed to prevent sticking. Brush melted butter over top and roll dough into a log.</li>
                <li> Cut the log crosswise into about 24 slices. Roll each slice into a disk.</li>
            </ol>
